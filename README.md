# Customer Churn Prediction with Telecom Data

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! In this project, we aim to predict customer churn and identify the features that increase the likelihood of customer churn using Telecom data. This project is designed to help telecom companies understand and reduce customer churn, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and revenue retention.

## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. For telecom companies, reducing churn is critical, as it can be costly to acquire new customers compared to retaining existing ones. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict which customers are likely to churn and identifies the factors contributing to churn.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed three machine learning models to predict customer churn:

1. **Logistic Regression Model**: This model uses a straightforward approach to classify customers into churn or non-churn categories based on historical data.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model**: The SVM model is designed to find a hyperplane that best separates churn and non-churn customers.

3. **Decision Tree Classifier Model**: This model provides insights into feature importance by ranking the factors contributing to customer churn.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: We gather telecom data, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer churn history.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded for modeling.

3. **Model Training**: The three machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict customer churn.

4. **Feature Importance**: The Decision Tree Classifier model is used to rank the importance of different features in predicting churn.

5. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the reliability of predictions.

6. **Prediction**: Using the best-performing model, we make predictions on new data to identify potential churners.

## Key Features

- **Non-Technical**: This project is designed for a non-technical audience, making it accessible to telecom professionals without a deep background in data science or machine learning.

- **Actionable Insights**: The Decision Tree Classifier model provides actionable insights by highlighting the most influential factors leading to customer churn.

- **Easy to Use**: The project is user-friendly and can be applied to new data with minimal technical expertise.

## Getting Started

To use this project for predicting customer churn, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can find the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository. Follow the step-by-step instructions to load your telecom data and make predictions.

4. **Interpret Results**: Review the model predictions and the feature importance rankings to understand which factors are most likely to cause customer churn.

## Results

We have achieved promising results in predicting customer churn using the three models. By analyzing the feature importance from the Decision Tree Classifier model, we have identified the key factors that contribute to customer churn. These insights can help telecom companies take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Conclusion

Reducing customer churn is essential for telecom companies to maintain profitability and customer satisfaction. This project offers a user-friendly approach to predicting churn and understanding the factors that influence it. By implementing the insights gained from this project, telecom companies can take targeted actions to reduce churn and improve their business outcomes.
